# SGE
SGE stands for "steve6472's gaming engine" but includes more that that!
This library features custom (& inconsistent) GUI system (Without any documentation because I have no idea how to write it) 
Main library for all my games/programmes.
You can copy or change any part of the library as long as you credit me.
